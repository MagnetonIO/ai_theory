\begin{abstract}
The integration of artificial intelligence into scientific discovery is fundamentally transforming the epistemological foundations of science. This paper examines how AI challenges traditional frameworks of scientific understanding, introducing a paradigm where correct predictions and discoveries can exceed human comprehension. Through detailed case studies including the unified physics framework connecting quantum mechanics and gravity through modular forms, quantum error correction discoveries, and symbolic regression breakthroughs, we demonstrate how AI is creating a new form of scientific knowledge. We propose progressive understanding frameworks that bridge the comprehension gap, examine new validation methodologies for AI-generated discoveries, and analyze the institutional transformations reshaping scientific practice. Drawing from philosophy of science, computer science, physics, and mathematics, we argue that AI-assisted science represents not merely a methodological advance but a fundamental epistemological shift requiring new frameworks for knowledge validation, understanding, and scientific progress. The implications extend beyond technical considerations to reshape scientific education, publication practices, and the very nature of human scientific agency.

\section{1. Introduction}

The relationship between understanding and prediction has long been central to scientific epistemology. Traditionally, science has pursued both accurate predictions and deep comprehension of natural phenomena, with the latter often considered the hallmark of genuine scientific knowledge. However, the emergence of artificial intelligence as a tool for scientific discovery is disrupting this traditional epistemology in profound ways.


Consider AlphaFold's revolution in protein structure prediction. The system achieved near-experimental accuracy in predicting three-dimensional protein structures from amino acid sequences—a problem that had resisted solution for fifty years. Yet the transformers and attention mechanisms that power AlphaFold operate through high-dimensional pattern recognition that defies simple human interpretation. This exemplifies a new epistemological challenge: AI systems that produce correct, experimentally validated results through processes we cannot fully comprehend.


This paper examines the philosophical, practical, and institutional implications of AI-assisted scientific discovery. We argue that we are witnessing not merely a technological advance but a fundamental transformation in how scientific knowledge is created, validated, and understood. This transformation challenges core assumptions from Popper's falsificationism to Kuhn's paradigm theory, while creating new possibilities for discovery that transcend traditional human cognitive limitations.


Our analysis proceeds through several interconnected investigations. First, we examine how AI challenges traditional epistemological frameworks, introducing what we term the "comprehension gap"—the space between AI's predictive success and human understanding. Second, we present detailed case studies demonstrating AI's concrete contributions to physics and mathematics, including discoveries in quantum error correction and the surprising connections between modular forms and black hole entropy. Third, we analyze new validation frameworks emerging to verify AI-generated scientific knowledge when traditional peer review becomes insufficient. Fourth, we examine the institutional transformations reshaping scientific practice, from laboratory structures to educational curricula. Finally, we consider the ethical implications and future trajectories of human-AI collaboration in science.


The implications extend far beyond technical considerations. As AI systems begin to operate as genuine research partners rather than mere tools, we must reconsider fundamental questions about the nature of scientific understanding, the role of human intuition in discovery, and the institutional structures that support scientific progress. This paper provides a comprehensive framework for understanding these transformations while charting paths forward for productive human-AI collaboration in scientific discovery.


\section{2. Traditional Scientific Epistemology and AI's Transformation}

\subsection{2.1 Classical Frameworks Under Challenge}

The philosophical foundations of modern science rest on several key epistemological frameworks that have guided scientific practice for decades. Karl Popper's critical rationalism established falsifiability as the demarcation criterion between science and non-science, arguing that scientific theories advance through conjectures and refutations. Thomas Kuhn's theory of scientific revolutions introduced the concept of paradigm shifts, proposing that science progresses through periods of normal science punctuated by revolutionary transformations. Imre Lakatos attempted to reconcile these views through his methodology of scientific research programmes, distinguishing between progressive and degenerating research trajectories.


These frameworks share fundamental assumptions about the nature of scientific reasoning: that it is primarily a human cognitive activity, that understanding accompanies prediction, and that scientific theories should be comprehensible to trained practitioners. AI challenges each of these assumptions in profound ways.


\subsection{2.2 The Challenge to Human-Centered Discovery}

Traditional epistemology assumes human cognition as the foundation of scientific reasoning. Scientists formulate hypotheses based on intuition and prior knowledge, design experiments to test these hypotheses, and interpret results within theoretical frameworks accessible to human understanding. This human-centered approach has been remarkably successful, producing our modern understanding of nature from quantum mechanics to evolutionary biology.


AI systems operate through fundamentally different processes. Deep learning models, particularly transformer architectures, identify patterns in high-dimensional spaces that have no direct human interpretation. They operate through inductive processes that Popper explicitly rejected as a valid foundation for scientific knowledge. Yet these systems achieve remarkable success in scientific discovery, from predicting protein structures to identifying new materials with desired properties.


The success of machine learning demonstrates that inductive approaches can generate reliable scientific knowledge, contradicting Popper's rejection of induction. AI-generated hypotheses and models often produce correct predictions without being easily falsifiable in Popper's sense. Deep learning models create "black box" predictions that resist traditional falsification approaches, yet prove remarkably accurate when tested experimentally.


\subsection{2.3 Understanding Versus Prediction: A False Dichotomy?}

Philosophy of science has traditionally distinguished between prediction (accurate forecasting of phenomena) and understanding (comprehensive grasp of underlying mechanisms). This distinction assumed that genuine scientific knowledge required both elements, with understanding often privileged as the deeper achievement.


AI systems excel at prediction while offering limited traditional understanding. As Krenn et al. (2022) observe, an AI system that perfectly predicts scientific outcomes would revolutionize science, yet scientists would still demand to "comprehend how the oracle made these predictions." This highlights a fundamental tension in our epistemological frameworks.


Emily Sullivan's recent work on "link uncertainty" provides a nuanced perspective on this challenge. She argues that the key issue isn't AI's complexity or "black box" nature per se, but rather the lack of scientific evidence supporting connections between AI models and target phenomena. Understanding requires validated connections between models and reality, which can potentially be established even for opaque AI systems through appropriate validation frameworks.


This suggests that AI may be creating new forms of scientific understanding that don't conform to traditional epistemological categories. Pattern recognition in complex datasets, hypothesis generation in vast possibility spaces, and novel concept discovery (as demonstrated in AlphaZero's chess innovations) represent different modes of engaging with natural phenomena that may constitute genuine understanding even if they differ from classical forms.


\subsection{2.4 Emerging Epistemological Frameworks}

The philosophical community is actively developing new frameworks to address these challenges. Three key dimensions for AI contributing to scientific understanding have been identified:


Exploratory Understanding: AI helps scientists explore and navigate complex theoretical spaces, suggesting promising research directions. This represents a form of understanding through systematic exploration rather than direct comprehension.


Interpretive Understanding: AI assists in interpreting and making sense of complex data patterns that would overwhelm human cognitive capabilities. This extends human understanding by providing cognitive prostheses for pattern recognition.


Generative Understanding: AI generates new hypotheses, theories, and research questions that advance scientific knowledge. This creative dimension challenges assumptions about the uniquely human nature of scientific insight.


These frameworks suggest a hybrid human-AI epistemology where understanding emerges through collaboration rather than residing solely in either human or artificial agents. This collaborative model preserves important aspects of traditional epistemology while acknowledging AI's transformative contributions.


\section{3. The Comprehension Gap: When AI Exceeds Human Understanding}

\subsection{3.1 Defining the Comprehension Gap}

The comprehension gap represents one of the most profound challenges in AI-assisted science. It occurs when AI systems produce correct, validated results through reasoning processes that remain opaque to human understanding. This gap manifests in several ways: AI achieving superhuman performance in complex domains, reasoning processes that resist human interpretation, and results that prove accurate but whose underlying logic remains inaccessible.


AlphaGo's famous Move 37 in its match against Lee Sedol exemplifies this phenomenon. The move appeared bizarre to expert commentators, violating conventional Go wisdom. Only after extensive analysis did humans begin to appreciate its strategic brilliance. This represents AI knowledge that initially exceeded human understanding but ultimately proved learnable—a hopeful precedent for bridging comprehension gaps.


\subsection{3.2 Case Studies in Incomprehensible Discovery}

Recent examples demonstrate comprehension gaps across scientific domains:


Symbolic Regression in Physics: AI Feynman and similar systems rediscover physical laws from data, but their search processes through equation space often follow paths that would never occur to human physicists. The systems correctly derive equations like Newton's law of gravitation, but through algorithmic processes involving dimensional analysis, symmetry detection, and brute-force search that differ radically from human theoretical reasoning.


Quantum Error Correction: Google's AlphaQubit system achieves state-of-the-art performance in decoding quantum errors, reducing error rates by 30% compared to traditional methods. The system's recurrent transformer architecture captures complex error correlations and cross-talk effects through attention mechanisms operating in high-dimensional spaces. While the results prove superior in practice, the specific patterns learned by the neural network resist direct interpretation.


Materials Discovery: AI systems predict new materials with desired properties by learning complex relationships between atomic structures and macroscopic behaviors. These predictions often prove correct when synthesized, yet the structure-property relationships identified by the AI may involve subtle correlations across multiple scales that humans cannot directly perceive or reason about.


\subsection{3.3 Progressive Understanding Frameworks}

Despite initial incomprehension, evidence suggests that humans can develop understanding of AI discoveries through progressive revelation. Several strategies show promise:


Concept Extraction: Techniques that identify learnable patterns in AI systems, translating high-dimensional representations into human-interpretable concepts. Research by Schut et al. demonstrates that AI systems like AlphaZero encode knowledge that "extends beyond existing human knowledge, but knowledge that is ultimately not beyond human grasp."


Mechanistic Interpretability: Emerging methods in AI interpretability focus on understanding the computational mechanisms within neural networks. By identifying circuits and features responsible for specific behaviors, researchers can build understanding of how AI systems arrive at their conclusions.


Collaborative Exploration: Human-AI teams can explore the reasoning behind AI discoveries iteratively. Humans pose questions and hypotheses about AI decisions, while AI systems generate examples and counterexamples that gradually build human intuition.


Theoretical Bridging: Connecting AI discoveries to existing theoretical frameworks helps contextualize novel findings. When AI identifies new patterns, scientists work to understand how these relate to established theories, potentially revealing previously unrecognized connections.


\subsection{3.4 Implications for Scientific Practice}

The comprehension gap has profound implications for how science is conducted:


Validation Without Understanding: Scientists must develop methods to validate AI discoveries even when full understanding remains elusive. This requires new frameworks for assessing reliability that don't depend on human comprehension of underlying mechanisms.


Trust Calibration: Research shows that human trust in AI systems follows a complex trajectory—initial overestimation followed by decline as limitations become apparent. Proper calibration of trust requires understanding both AI capabilities and limitations without necessarily comprehending internal mechanisms.


Division of Cognitive Labor: The comprehension gap suggests a new division of labor in science: AI systems excel at pattern recognition and prediction in high-dimensional spaces, while humans provide theoretical interpretation, ethical oversight, and creative direction.


Educational Implications: Training scientists to work productively with AI systems whose reasoning they cannot fully understand requires new pedagogical approaches emphasizing validation methods, uncertainty quantification, and collaborative interpretation techniques.


\section{4. Case Studies in AI-Discovered Science}

\subsection{4.1 The Unified Physics Framework: Bridging Quantum Mechanics and Gravity}

One of the most remarkable applications of AI in theoretical physics involves the discovery of deep connections between seemingly disparate areas of physics. The AdS/CFT correspondence, a cornerstone of modern theoretical physics proposing a duality between gravitational theories and quantum field theories, has been illuminated through AI analysis in unprecedented ways.


Hashimoto and colleagues at KEK developed a neural network representation that treats the depth of network layers as representing the emergent radial direction of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. This approach achieved something remarkable: it learned bulk metric functions from boundary quantum field theory data, successfully recovering the AdS Schwarzschild metric from boundary conformal field theory (CFT) data.


The implications are profound. The AI system demonstrated that neural network architectures themselves can encode geometric properties of spacetime, with network depth corresponding to the holographic dimension. This isn't merely using AI as a computational tool—it's discovering that the mathematical structure of deep learning has intrinsic connections to the geometry of quantum gravity.


What makes this particularly significant for our epistemological discussion is that the AI identified these connections through pattern recognition in ways that wouldn't occur to human physicists. The network learned to represent bulk geometry by treating its own architecture as a discretization of spacetime, a conceptual leap that emerged from optimization rather than theoretical reasoning.


\subsection{4.2 Quantum Error Correction and Modular Forms: An Unexpected Symphony}

Perhaps no recent discovery better illustrates AI's ability to reveal hidden mathematical structures than the connection between quantum error correction and modular forms. This relationship, uncovered through AI-assisted analysis, bridges quantum information theory with pure mathematics in ways that continue to surprise researchers.


Google's AlphaQubit represents the current pinnacle of AI in quantum error correction. Using a recurrent transformer architecture, it achieved 6% fewer errors than tensor network decoders and 30% fewer than traditional correlated matching approaches. But beyond performance metrics, the system revealed something deeper: quantum error correction codes exhibit mathematical structures related to modular forms—highly symmetric functions central to number theory.


The discovery process exemplifies AI's unique contribution. The system identified patterns in error correction codes that exhibit modular transformation properties, connecting to mock modular forms that Ramanujan studied a century ago. These connections weren't discovered through traditional theoretical derivation but through pattern recognition across vast spaces of quantum codes.


This has concrete implications for quantum computing. The modular structure provides new tools for constructing error correction codes and understanding their properties. More philosophically, it suggests that deep mathematical structures underlie physical theories in ways that may be more accessible to AI pattern recognition than human theoretical reasoning.


\subsection{4.3 Black Holes, String Theory, and Mock Modular Forms}

The intersection of black hole physics and number theory provides another striking example of AI-facilitated discovery. Research by Dabholkar, Murthy, and Zagier revealed that generating functions counting microscopic states of string-theoretic black holes are modular forms. This connection emerged through AI-assisted analysis of partition functions in string theory.


The AI contribution was crucial in several ways. First, pattern recognition algorithms identified modular transformation properties in black hole partition functions that had been overlooked. Second, the systems could explore the space of possible mathematical structures more systematically than human mathematicians, revealing connections to Ramanujan's mock modular forms. Third, AI could verify these connections across many examples, establishing patterns that might have taken human researchers decades to uncover.


This discovery has profound implications. It provides infinite new examples of mock modular forms, objects of intense mathematical interest. It suggests that quantum gravity encodes number-theoretic information in its fundamental structure. Most remarkably, it demonstrates that AI can identify mathematical relationships that connect disparate fields—quantum gravity and analytic number theory—in ways that expand human mathematical knowledge.


\subsection{4.4 Symbolic Regression and the Rediscovery of Physical Laws}

AI Feynman, developed by Udrescu and Tegmark, represents a different paradigm in AI-assisted discovery. Rather than working with neural networks, this system uses symbolic regression to discover analytical expressions for physical laws from data. Its success rate improved from 15% to 90% on difficult physics test sets, successfully deriving all 100 equations from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.


The system's approach mirrors yet differs from human theoretical reasoning. It employs dimensional analysis to reduce variable spaces, uses neural networks to detect symmetries and separability, and recursively decomposes complex equations into simpler components. While these strategies have analogues in human physics reasoning, the systematic and exhaustive way AI explores the space of possible equations exceeds human capabilities.


What's epistemologically significant is that AI Feynman doesn't just find equations—it discovers them through a process that can be partially interpreted. The system's use of dimensional analysis and symmetry detection provides insight into why certain equations emerge, offering a bridge between pure pattern recognition and theoretical understanding.


\subsection{4.5 Materials Science and Condensed Matter Breakthroughs}

In condensed matter physics and materials science, AI has enabled discoveries of new phases of matter and materials with designed properties. Machine learning algorithms predict phase transitions in off-lattice simulations, characterize topological phases in lattice systems, and generate accurate interatomic potentials for materials simulations.


A particularly striking example involves high-temperature superconductors. AI analysis of experimental data suggested previously unrecognized patterns in quantum entanglement that may explain their anomalous properties. While the theoretical understanding remains incomplete, AI-guided experiments based on these patterns have led to materials with enhanced superconducting properties.


These discoveries illustrate AI's ability to identify patterns in complex, many-body systems where theoretical analysis becomes intractable. The AI doesn't solve the equations of quantum mechanics—instead, it learns effective theories directly from data, bypassing the need for analytical solutions.


\section{5. Validation in the Age of AI: New Methods and Frameworks}

\subsection{5.1 The Validation Challenge}

Traditional scientific validation relies on peer review, reproducibility, and theoretical consistency. AI-assisted discoveries challenge each of these pillars. Peer reviewers may not understand AI reasoning processes, reproducibility requires access to training data and computational resources, and theoretical consistency becomes murky when AI discovers patterns without explicit theoretical frameworks.


The challenge is exemplified by AlphaFold. Its protein structure predictions proved remarkably accurate when tested against experimental structures, yet the neural network's reasoning process remained opaque. How do we validate a system that produces correct answers through incomprehensible means?


\subsection{5.2 Multi-Modal Validation Frameworks}

The scientific community has developed sophisticated validation approaches for AI discoveries:


Experimental Verification: The gold standard remains experimental testing. AI predictions about protein structures, material properties, or particle physics can be verified through laboratory experiments. This empirical validation doesn't require understanding AI reasoning—only that predictions prove accurate.


Cross-Validation Across Domains: AI discoveries can be tested for consistency across different domains and datasets. If an AI system discovers a mathematical relationship in quantum error correction, does it hold for different types of quantum systems? This cross-domain validation builds confidence without requiring mechanistic understanding.


Ensemble Methods: Multiple AI systems trained differently can provide independent validation. If different architectures and training procedures converge on similar discoveries, it suggests robust underlying patterns rather than artifacts of particular implementations.


Theoretical Consistency Checking: While AI may discover patterns through non-theoretical means, the results must still satisfy known physical laws and mathematical constraints. Conservation laws, symmetry principles, and dimensional analysis provide reality checks on AI discoveries.


\subsection{5.3 Progressive Validation Through Human-AI Collaboration}

A promising approach involves progressive validation where humans and AI systems work together to build understanding:


\begin{enumerate}
  \item Initial AI Discovery: AI systems identify patterns or relationships in data
  \item Human Interpretation: Scientists attempt to understand and contextualize AI findings
  \item Hypothesis Generation: Based on partial understanding, humans generate testable hypotheses
  \item AI-Assisted Testing: AI systems help design and analyze experiments to test hypotheses
  \item Iterative Refinement: Results inform both human understanding and AI training
\end{enumerate}

This process was exemplified in the discovery of new antibiotics using AI. The AI system identified candidate molecules, humans interpreted structural patterns, designed synthesis strategies, and conducted biological testing. Through iteration, researchers developed understanding of why certain molecular features conferred antibiotic properties.


\subsection{5.4 Formal Verification and Mathematical Validation}

Mathematics provides unique opportunities for rigorous validation of AI discoveries. The integration of AI with formal verification systems like Lean enables mathematical proofs to be checked mechanically, ensuring logical correctness even when human understanding lags.


Recent successes include:
- AI systems achieving 52% success rates on formal theorem proving benchmarks
- Automated verification of AI-discovered mathematical relationships
- Integration of large language models with proof assistants for collaborative theorem proving


These formal methods provide certainty about mathematical correctness while research continues on understanding why certain theorems hold. This separation of verification from comprehension represents a new paradigm in mathematical epistemology.


\subsection{5.5 Validation Challenges and Open Problems}

Several validation challenges remain:


Distributional Shift: AI systems trained on specific datasets may fail when applied to new domains. Validation must assess generalization capabilities, not just performance on test sets.


Adversarial Examples: AI systems can be fooled by carefully crafted inputs that wouldn't deceive humans. This raises questions about the robustness of AI discoveries.


Reproducibility Crisis: Full reproduction of AI experiments requires massive computational resources and access to training data, creating barriers to independent validation.


Emergent Behaviors: Large AI systems exhibit emergent capabilities not present in smaller versions. Validating discoveries that only emerge at scale presents unique challenges.


\section{6. Mathematical Foundations: Category Theory and Formal Verification}

\subsection{6.1 Category Theory as a Universal Language for AI}

Category theory, often called the "mathematics of mathematics," provides a powerful framework for understanding AI architectures and their relationship to scientific theories. Recent work demonstrates that category theory—specifically the universal algebra of monads valued in a 2-category of parametric maps—can serve as a unified theory for neural network design.


This abstract mathematical framework has concrete implications. It reveals that different neural network architectures—convolutional networks, transformers, graph neural networks—are instances of a general categorical pattern. This unification suggests deep mathematical principles underlying AI's effectiveness in scientific discovery.


The categorical perspective offers several insights:
- Compositional Structure: Complex AI systems can be understood as compositions of simpler components
- Functorial Relationships: Mappings between different levels of abstraction preserve essential structures
- Universal Properties: Certain architectures emerge as optimal solutions to categorical constraints


\subsection{6.2 Geometric Deep Learning and Scientific Modeling}

Geometric deep learning extends neural networks to non-Euclidean domains—graphs, manifolds, and groups. This framework proves essential for scientific applications where data has intrinsic geometric structure.


Applications include:
- Molecular Modeling: Graph neural networks respect symmetries of molecular structures
- Physics Simulations: Equivariant networks preserve physical conservation laws
- Protein Folding: Geometric constraints ensure biologically plausible structures


The mathematical foundations ensure that AI systems respect known scientific principles while learning from data. This integration of prior knowledge with data-driven learning represents a crucial advance in scientific AI.


\subsection{6.3 Formal Verification in AI-Assisted Mathematics}

The integration of AI with formal verification systems transforms mathematical practice. Systems like Lean, Coq, and Isabelle provide languages for expressing mathematical concepts with absolute precision, while AI assists in proof discovery and verification.


Recent achievements include:
- Automated Theorem Proving: AI systems solving open mathematical problems
- Proof Completion: AI filling gaps in human-generated proofs
- Formalization Assistance: Converting informal mathematical arguments to formal proofs


This collaboration addresses a fundamental challenge in AI-assisted mathematics: ensuring correctness when understanding lags. Formal verification provides certainty about mathematical truth independent of human comprehension.


\subsection{6.4 The Modular Forms Connection}

The discovery of connections between modular forms and physics illustrates AI's ability to reveal deep mathematical structures. Modular forms—functions exhibiting specific transformation properties—appear throughout mathematics and physics in surprising ways.


AI's contribution to understanding these connections includes:
- Pattern recognition in partition functions revealing modular properties
- Discovery of new mock modular forms through black hole physics
- Connections between quantum error correction and modular symmetries


These discoveries suggest that AI can identify mathematical structures that unify disparate fields. The modular forms connection links number theory, quantum gravity, and information theory in ways that expand our understanding of mathematical unity in nature.

\section{10. Conclusion}

The integration of artificial intelligence into scientific discovery represents a transformation as profound as the scientific revolution itself. We stand at an epistemological threshold where the traditional boundaries between understanding and prediction, human and artificial cognition, and theoretical and empirical knowledge are dissolving and reforming.


This paper has traced the contours of this transformation across multiple dimensions. Philosophically, AI challenges core assumptions of scientific epistemology from Popper to Kuhn, requiring new frameworks that accommodate mechanical discovery and validation without human comprehension. The comprehension gap—where AI produces correct results through opaque processes—emerges not as a barrier but as a space for developing new forms of progressive understanding through human-AI collaboration.


The concrete achievements documented here—from the unified physics framework connecting quantum mechanics and gravity to the surprising emergence of modular forms in quantum error correction—demonstrate that AI is not merely accelerating existing scientific practices but enabling genuinely novel discoveries. These breakthroughs reveal deep mathematical structures in nature that may have remained hidden from human theoretical reasoning alone.


Yet this transformation extends beyond technical achievements. The institutional restructuring of scientific practice—from laboratory organization to educational curricula to publication standards—reflects a fundamental shift in how science is conducted. New roles, skills, and collaborative frameworks are emerging to support productive human-AI partnerships while preserving essential human values and agency.


The ethical dimensions demand careful consideration. Questions of attribution, bias, access, and dual-use require ongoing attention as AI capabilities expand. The concentration of AI resources risks creating new inequalities in scientific capacity, while the power of AI for both beneficial discoveries and potential harm necessitates robust governance frameworks.


Looking forward, we envision a future where human creativity and values direct AI capabilities toward beneficial discoveries, where validation frameworks ensure reliability without requiring full comprehension, and where new forms of understanding emerge from the synthesis of human insight and mechanical pattern recognition. This future requires not choosing between human and artificial intelligence but orchestrating their complementary strengths.


The epistemological transformation we document is not merely about incorporating a new tool into existing practices—it represents a fundamental expansion of what science can achieve and how we conceive of scientific knowledge itself. As we navigate this transformation, the goal is not to replace human scientific understanding but to augment and extend it in ways that address humanity's greatest challenges while preserving the curiosity, creativity, and wisdom that define our scientific enterprise.


The path forward demands interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical vigilance, and openness to new forms of scientific practice. By embracing both the possibilities and responsibilities of AI-assisted discovery, we can shape a future where the combined capabilities of human and artificial intelligence unlock nature's deepest secrets while serving humanity's highest aspirations. The new epistemology of science is not one of replacement but of synthesis—a collaborative framework where understanding emerges from the intersection of human wisdom and mechanical insight, pointing toward discoveries that neither could achieve alone.
