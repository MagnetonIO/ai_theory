\begin{abstract}
Large language models (LLMs) face critical challenges in scaling efficiency, dynamic sparsity, and inference throughput. We present the KalmaGrove-Arnold Network (KAN), a groundbreaking architecture that combines the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem with adaptive sparsity to deliver unprecedented efficiency. KAN achieves:\newline
\textbf{1.} Up to \textit{9$\times$ cost reduction}, reducing training costs to \$230k for 340B parameters.\newline
\textbf{2.} \textit{6.2$\times$ faster training} throughput.\newline
\textbf{3.} \textit{Tensorized Arnold Diffusion Attention (ADA)}, achieving 94\% sparsity during inference.\newline
Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks with transformative cost-efficiency gains.

\section{Introduction}
The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) demands a focus on efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. While existing architectures such as DeepSeek-R1 improve reasoning capabilities using reinforcement learning and multi-stage fine-tuning, they are constrained by quadratic attention overhead and fixed activation mechanisms.\newline
This paper introduces KalmaGrove-Arnold Networks (KAN), which redefine scalability with dynamic sparsity, tensorized attention mechanisms, and adaptive hardware alignment. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, KAN transitions from node-based activations to learnable edge-based activations, enabling a 9$\times$ reduction in training cost for 340B-parameter models while maintaining competitive accuracy.

\section{Key Innovations in KAN}
\subsection{Kolmogorov-Arnold Edge Activations}
The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem guarantees that any multivariate function can be approximated through compositions of univariate functions. KAN leverages this insight to replace traditional node-based nonlinearities with learnable edge activations, parameterized using B-splines or piecewise polynomials.

\textbf{Advantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Finer granularity:} Each edge can independently optimize its activation shape.
    \item \textbf{Sparse gradients:} Gradient flow is naturally sparse, reducing computation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{KalmaGrove Dynamic Subnets}
KAN introduces KalmaGroves, dynamically gated subnets activated per input, achieving 94\% sparsity at runtime. The gating mechanism is defined as:
\[
\mathcal{G}_t(x) = \sigma(W_g x + b_g) \odot \text{TopK}\Bigl(\|E_i x\|_2\Bigr),
\]
where \(\sigma\) is a gating function, and \(\text{TopK}\) selects the most relevant subnets. This adaptive approach minimizes inactive parameters, translating directly into FLOP reductions.

\subsection{Tensorized Arnold Diffusion Attention (ADA)}
KAN replaces quadratic softmax attention with ADA, formulated as:
\[
\mathrm{ADA}(Q, K, V) = \frac{Q (K \star \mathcal{K})^T}{\sqrt{d}} V,
\]
where \(\mathcal{K}\) is a learnable kernel, enabling diffusion-like transformations. This approach reduces complexity from \(\mathcal{O}(n^2 d)\) to \(\mathcal{O}(nd)\), making long-context processing tractable.

\subsection{Hardware Co-design}
KAN's custom CUDA kernels exploit structured sparsity at the kernel level, ensuring efficient hardware utilization. This co-design maximizes throughput and minimizes memory overhead, especially for large-scale models.

\section{Experimental Results}
\subsection{Benchmark Performance}
KAN outperforms DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4 across standard benchmarks, achieving:\newline
\textbf{1.} MMLU accuracy of 83.1 (vs. DeepSeek-R1's 82.3).\newline
\textbf{2.} Inference throughput of 891 tokens/sec on NVIDIA A100 (vs. DeepSeek-R1's 312 tokens/sec).

\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Params} & \textbf{Cost (USD)} & \textbf{MMLU Score} \\

DeepSeek-R1 & 340B & \$2.1M & 82.3 \\
KAN & 340B & \$230k & 83.1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Inference Latency}
KAN's KalmaGroves and ADA enable nearly 3$\times$ faster inference throughput, making it ideal for real-time applications.

\subsection{Training Efficiency}
Training costs are reduced by up to 9$\times$ compared to DeepSeek-R1, thanks to dynamic sparsity and tensorized attention. Figure~\ref{fig:training} illustrates the throughput gains achieved with KAN.

\section{Discussion and Limitations}
\subsection{Edge-based Activations}
While edge activations offer finer granularity, their initialization for trillion-scale models remains computationally intensive. Future work will explore efficient initialization methods.

\subsection{Hardware Dependency}
KAN's reliance on custom CUDA kernels for optimal performance may limit portability. Addressing this requires adapting the architecture for broader hardware compatibility.

\subsection{Scaling Beyond Trillions}
Extending KAN's principles to trillion-scale models will require additional research into sparsity-aware optimizations and distributed training frameworks.

\section{Conclusion}
KAN represents a paradigm shift in LLM design, achieving unmatched efficiency and scalability. By integrating sparsity, dynamic gating, and tensorized attention, KAN paves the way for cost-effective trillion-parameter models. Future work will extend these innovations to broader domains and hardware platforms.
